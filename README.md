# OSSM-Reference-PCB-housing
Housing cover for the OSSM Reference PCB V1 boards.

It will work for the V2 boards however the RGB LED is in a different position, so you will need to edit the model to accomdate this.

Currently the USB port hole is slightly misaligned, you can still plug the USB C cable in without issue.
Happy printing.
